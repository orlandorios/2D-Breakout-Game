# Building a Game with Canvas and JS - MDN

### In this repository, you will put your code you write for the MDN [2D Breakout Game Using Pure JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) tutorial. 

- The goal here is to get practice reading and writing JS syntax, expecially variables, loops, and functions.
- This tutorial uses a built-in HTML element called `<canvas>` and methods and attributes of that element. 
- When you feel comfortable getting the syntax to work as written in the tutorial, go ahead and make additions and modifications of your choice.
